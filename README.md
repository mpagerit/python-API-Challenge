# python-API-Challenge

This project uses Python, matplotlib, and pandas to analyze the weather and climate in over 500 cities throughout the world.

The 500 cities were generated through the OpenWeatherMap API. I analyzed teh relationship of latitude to temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and wind speed. I then used the city list to find 10 vaction destinations and mapped them.
